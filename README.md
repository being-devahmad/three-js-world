# Introduction to ThreeJS World

This project serves as an introduction to Three.js and WebGL, exploring various concepts and techniques in 3D web graphics. It includes two implementations: one using simple HTML/CSS/JS and another using Vite with Vanilla JS.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore the following concepts:

1. Understanding WebGL and Three.js
2. Creating basic 3D objects (cube, sphere, cylinder)
3. Transformations (scale, rotation)
4. Animations
5. Responsiveness and window resizing
6. Orbit controls for camera manipulation
7. Textures and materials
8. Lighting in 3D scenes
9. Adding 3D models
10. Using lil-gui for debug UI

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main implementations:

1. **Simple HTML/CSS/JS Version**
   - Located in the `/simple` directory
   - Uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
   - Demonstrates core Three.js concepts without build tools

2. **Vite + Vanilla JS Version**
   - Located in the `/vite-version` directory
   - Uses Vite as a build tool for improved development experience
   - Implements the same features as the simple version but with a more modern setup

## Getting Started

### Simple HTML/CSS/JS Version

1. Navigate to the `/simple` directory
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser

### Vite + Vanilla JS Version

1. Navigate to the `/vite-version` directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the provided localhost URL in your browser

## Features

- **Basic 3D Objects**: Demonstrates creation of cubes, spheres, and cylinders
- **Transformations**: Showcases scaling and rotation of 3D objects
- **Animations**: Implements basic animations for 3D objects
- **Responsiveness**: Handles window resizing for a consistent experience
- **Orbit Controls**: Allows camera manipulation for exploring the 3D scene
- **Textures and Materials**: Applies textures and different materials to objects
- **Lighting**: Implements various lighting techniques in the 3D environment
- **3D Models**: Demonstrates loading and displaying external 3D models
- **Debug UI**: Uses lil-gui for adjusting parameters in real-time

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, you will gain understanding of:

- The basics of WebGL and its role in 3D web graphics
- Three.js library and its core concepts
- Creating and manipulating 3D objects in a web environment
- Implementing interactivity and animations in 3D scenes
- Working with textures, materials, and lighting in Three.js
- Setting up a modern development environment with Vite for 3D web projects
